OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) helps identify the most common security vulnerabilities in web applications. This project can assist developers in building secure web applications.

Details:

You could create a Python tool or script that automatically tests for common vulnerabilities listed in the OWASP Top 10. This tool would help identify vulnerabilities like XSS, SQL Injection, CSRF, etc., in web applications.

Example:

*Purpose of the Tool: Automatically detects common security vulnerabilities in web applications.

*Technologies Used: Python, Requests library, BeautifulSoup (for HTML parsing)

*How It Works: The user enters a URL, and the tool scans the website, performing tests for vulnerabilities from OWASP Top 10. For instance, it could test for SQL injection, form validation issues, cookie security, etc.


import requests

def sql_injection_test(url):
    payload = "' OR 1=1 --"
    response = requests.get(url + "?id=" + payload)
    if "error" not in response.text.lower():
        return True
    return False

url = input("Enter the URL to test: ")
if sql_injection_test(url):
    print("SQL Injection vulnerability found!")
else:
    print("No SQL Injection vulnerability detected.")

    This simple test checks for SQL injection vulnerabilities on a given URL.
